## Customization

This project was created for my grandmother but is designed to be easily customizable:

### Artist Configuration

The site has a centralized artist configuration file at `lib/config.ts` that contains all artist-specific information:

```typescript
// Update this file to customize for different artists
export const artistConfig = {
  // Basic information
  name: "Your Name",
  businessName: "Your Business Name",
  
  // Contact information
  contact: {
    email: "your.email@example.com",
    phone: "+1 (123) 456-7890",
  },
  
  // SEO and metadata
  seo: {
    title: "Your Business Name",
    description: "Your business description",
  },
  
  // Marketing content
  marketing: {
    tagline: "Your tagline here",
    subTagline: "Secondary tagline or description",
    aboutDescription: [
      "First paragraph about your business.",
      "Second paragraph with more details."
    ],
  },
  
  // Social media links
  social: {
    instagram: "",
    facebook: "",
    linkedin: "",
    houzz: "",
  },
  
  // Site configuration
  siteConfig: {
    copyright: `Â© ${new Date().getFullYear()} Your Business Name. All rights reserved.`,
    adminRoute: "/admin",
  }
}
```

This configuration is used throughout the application, making it easy to adapt the site for different artists without modifying multiple files.

Additional customizations:
- Update the logo, colors, and typography in the relevant CSS files
- Customize the admin dashboard for your specific needs
- Add additional features like testimonials, services pages, or blog functionality
